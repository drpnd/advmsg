## Design principles

* Autonomous and decentralized system
* Scalable system
* Open ecosystem
* Exntensibility

## Requirements

* Message storage like an IMAP mailbox
* Secure messaging between sender and receiver
* Provider-independent ID / address
* Secret recipient ID / address to unauthorized users
* 1-to-1 private messaging
* 1-to-N messaging
* Message thread support (e.g., `In-Reply-To` in E-mail header)
* Verification of the sender of a message
* Anonymous messaging
* Separation of human-friendly ID and other IDs (elimination of semantics from non-human-friendly IDs)
